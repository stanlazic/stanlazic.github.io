<h1>Stanley E. Lazic, PhD</h1>
  <p>Originally from Canada, I moved to Cambridge (UK) in 2002 for a PhD in neuroscience and stayed for a postdoc and a masters in computational biology. Since 2009 I've been living in Switzerland and working as a statistician/computational scientist in the pharmaceutical industry and in 2016 I moved back to Cambridge and joined the Quantitative Biology group at AstraZeneca as a Team Leader in Statistics.</p>

  <p>Research interests include the design and analysis of biological experiments, improving the reproducibility of biomedical research, and novel applications of Bayesian methods.</p>

  <p> Publication list is above and professional information can be found on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanlazic" target="blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
